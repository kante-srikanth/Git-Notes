# Git Notes and useful commands.

### Git Internals: git objects are created when commands are executed.
* Three main objects : tree, blob, and commit object.
* blob object contains contents of the file.
* tree object contains information about all the blob objects and filename that are related to that commit object.
* commit object contains information about tree object and parent commit object.
